                <p>
                        A system that provides real time emergency service vehicle tracking and a definite and clear path to the emergency service
                        vehicles while alerting the nearest Traffic Police organs enroute to monitor and clear the traffic
                        as situation requires. As soon as the vehicle is about to begin the journey, the driver will start
                        the navigation, enter the destination and the system will display the optimal route. Once the driver
                        starts navigating, all the details would be forwarded to the Police Control Room and the workstations
                        enroute. The Police Control Room can track and monitor all the running systems and change the route
                        in case the traffic at certain points are too congested to be cleared in minutes. The agents can
                        track the vehicles that are approaching their workstations and decide the right course of action
                        locally.

                        In the present art, the invention related to facilitating quick passage of a vehicle through a transportation system are
                        known to have following disadvantages:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>They require complex infrastructure supporting services.</li>
                        <li>Increased technical dependency.</li>
                        <li>Requires highly skilled workforce.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus there is a need to address the above mentioned disadvantages. The present invention aims to address
                        the above mentioned disadvantages.</p>
